The Simple Shell, an elegant UNIX command language interpreter, is a marvel of C implementation. With its ability to read commands from either a file or standard input, it offers a seamless user experience.

To ensure the highest standards of excellence, our team has compiled all files on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89. Our files are formatted with care to meet the Betty style, and all header files are include guarded.
